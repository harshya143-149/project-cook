                <h2> Chef Abinash Nayak </h2>
                <p>Specialist in odia cuisine Odia cuisine is the cuisine of the Indian state of Odisha. Compared to other regional Indian cuisines, Odia cuisine uses less oil and is less spicy, while nonetheless remaining flavourful. Rice is the staple food of this region. Mustard oil is used in some dishes as the cooking medium, but ghee (made of cow's milk) is preferred in temples. Odia foods traditionally served either on brass, bronze metal plates, banana leaf or disposable plates made of sal leaves.</p>

                <h2>Chef Natasha Gandhi</h2>
                <p>My forte is millet cooking and I love taking everyday dishes made with rice and wheat flour for example and swapping them with millet flour and trying to recreate the same taste and texture. I absolutely love making millet bread. I even make gluten-free bhatura, dahi vada, dhokla, etc. I just love giving a new shape to dishes with millet</p>
